                    Crypto Mining’s open-ended contracts are affected by three factors: difficult of mining, exchange rate of BTC and USD, and maintenance fees (daily). <br />
                    The first two factors are outside of Crypto Mining’s control with any issue mitigated by our pledge to always use the most powerful technologies available to us.<br />
                    The latter factor, the maintenance fee, is in place to partially support operational costs our end including cooling, electrical bills, physical maintenance and hosting services plus other essential operational elements.<br />
                    If the fee exceeds that of your mining output, your mining output will drop to zero. We will then support the contract for 60 days in case it returns to activity (due to crypto price increase or mining difficulty decrease).<br />
                    If this does not occur, the contract will be terminated.

                    At Crypto Mining we supply your mining outputs to your wallet as soon as the minimum required amount for transfer has been met. It is unfortunately not possible to advance or delay the sending of the mining deposit to meet any timed structure you may wish for. If you wish to discover your account’s minimum transaction amounts, visit your wallet section within your Crypto Mining personal account area.

                    Ethereum’s current PoW (Proof of Work) model makes for gradual release to miners based on proof of time and energy spent mining. Ethereum has stated that it is considering a future switch to PoS (Proof of Stake) approach, which will rely on length of hold as justification for release to miners.<br />
                    This will result in the end of the possibility to mine Ethereum via Crypto Mining. However, we will not disband the hashrate you have accumulated. We will reattribute this in a way to be confirmed – but rest assured your hard time spent will not go to waste. <br />
                    We will be prompt to update you on any development in this field as and when it is announced and takes place.

                    Crypto Mining always uses the correct fees to have the relevant blockchain approve the transaction as soon as your payment is received but occasionally there can be delays in the blockchain. This is to be expected and is no cause for concern. Please wait up to 48 hours before contacting customer support.

                    The Crypto Mining affiliate program could not be easier to use or more profitable. It all begins with an affiliate code that is unique to your account. Whenever a user registers and inputs your referral code, they receive 3% discount on whatever purchase they make. And you enjoy a significant hash power boost. <br />
                    The more referrals you make, the higher your affiliate rank rises. And the higher your affiliate rank, the bigger hashpower boost you enjoy.  <br />
                    It’s as simple and as profitable as that. We will be sure to remind you via your linked email whenever your referral code is used.

                    An affiliate URL and promotional code can be used in conjunction with the code taking precedent. If both are used by a new account, only the code’s supplier will be factored in.
